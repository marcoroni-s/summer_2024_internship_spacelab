This project involves sending an Arduino equipped with an altimeter sensor into the sky to record altitude data over time. The collected data is then processed and outputted as a table displaying height vs. time. This project is useful for high-altitude balloon experiments, model rocket flights, or any other application where altitude tracking is needed.This project is open-source. Feel free to modify and share it!
